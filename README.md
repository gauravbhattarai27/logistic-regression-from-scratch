Overview
This repository contains an implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch in Python. Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. Unlike linear regression, which is used for continuous outcomes, logistic regression predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

Features
Implemented from scratch: No use of libraries like scikit-learn for the core algorithm.
Gradient Descent Optimization: Uses gradient descent for optimizing the cost function.
Binary Classification: Designed to handle binary classification problems.
Modular Code: Easy to understand and extend for further development.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Numpy
